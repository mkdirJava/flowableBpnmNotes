Hercules Flowable playground

This project is here to demonstrate and concrete knowledge on flowable bpmn uses.

The project is structured as tests per bpmn component with unit tests and documentation.

its is hoped that using the javadoc test=javadoc execution
 
mvn clean  javadoc:test-javadoc

You can then go to 
flowableBpnmNotes\target\site\testapidocs\index.html 
this can be used to document progress

we can use this as a self documentation as this produces a javadoc websites with the test and comments, similar to a thread
